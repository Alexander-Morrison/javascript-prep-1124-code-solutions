## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?
  Strictly equal (using the === operator) means that two values are compared for both value
  and type without type coercion. If the values and types are the same, the result is true;
  otherwise, it is false.

- What is the logical **and** operator?
  The logical and operator in JavaScript is represented by &&. It evaluates two expressions
  and returns true only if both expressions are true. If either expression is false, it
  returns false.

- Can you name some comparison operators?
  == Equal
  === Strict Equal
  != Not Equal
  !== Strict Not Equal
  > Greater Than
  > < Less Than
  > = Greater Than or Equal To
  > <= Less Than or Equal To
