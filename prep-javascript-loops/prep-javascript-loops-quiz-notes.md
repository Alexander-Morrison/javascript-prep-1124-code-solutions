## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  It determines whether the loop will continue executing. If it evaluates to true, the loop runs; if false, it stops.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  The initialization is evaluated once at the start of the loop before any iterations.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop, including the first one.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  The final expression is evaluated after each iteration of the loop, right before the next condition check.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  It typically updates the loop counter or variable, controlling the progression of the loop.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  It should be used on objects to iterate over their enumerable properties, not for arrays or array-like objects.
